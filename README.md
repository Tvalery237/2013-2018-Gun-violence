# 2013-2018-Gun-violence
## Project summary
This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, documents more than 260,000 gun violence incidents across the United States from 2013 to 2018. It provides detailed information for each case, including location, date, casualties, and contributing factors. Designed to support research and analysis, the dataset serves as a valuable resource for data scientists and statisticians to uncover patterns, investigate root causes, and develop data-driven forecasts regarding future trends in gun violence.
## Key Questions
+  How have gun violence incidents evolved from 2013 to 2018?
+  Are certain months or seasons associated with higher rates of incidents?
